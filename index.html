			<h2>
				But, Who Am I? 
			</h2>

			<p>
				I am a very good listener and am often the agony aunt for many of my friends. I am your ideal partner in creating that extensive pro con list (that sometimes might help you make the right decision. If there are two potential outcomes, with my service, there is a 50% probability that you will make the right decision)

			<h2>
				Interests

				I love watching TV shows and movies. I often finish 10 episode shows in 1 night and then look forward to discussing them in detail. I am a great fan of murder mysteries and drama.
